- [Typed Spreadsheet Rabbita demo](../examples/typed_spreadsheet_rabbita_demo/README.md) — local browser-demo build and deployment notes

## Performance

- [Benchmarks](performance/benchmarks.md) — microbenchmark results for core operations (signal, memo, hybrid, batch). Dated snapshots; newer numbers go in new files.
- [2026-04-21 Pre-R1 Baseline](performance/2026-04-21-pre-r1-baseline.md) — frozen reference for R1 Stage 3 regression gate (≤2% per tracked path).
- [2026-04-24 R1 Stage 3 bench](performance/2026-04-24-r1-stage3-bench.md) — Stage 3 comparison vs baseline; all tracked rows within or favorable to ±2% gate.
- [2026-04-26 `memo_restore_on_abort` validation](performance/2026-04-26-memo-restore-on-abort-bench.md) — open-TODO microbench: O(n²) confirmed but constants too small to be actionable at realistic N.
- [2026-05-16 Push-engine link-list port microbench](performance/2026-05-16-push-engine-linklist-microbench.md) — alien-signals-style port investigation closed: measured 1.2–1.5× speedup, deprioritized in favor of higher-leverage targets.
- [2026-05-16 Push-engine cost decomposition](performance/2026-05-16-push-engine-cost-decomposition.md) — strategic ranking of push-engine performance interventions. Chosen direction: per-recompute allocation elimination (tracking-buffer reuse).
- [2026-05-16 Tracking-buffer lazy-allocation result](performance/2026-05-16-tracking-buffer-lazy-alloc.md) — implements the chosen direction. Pool reuse rejected by probe; lazy-allocation alone delivered −15.9% on 1000-fanout (−46 ns/r).
- [2026-05-17 T1b commit-path bench snapshot](performance/2026-05-17-t1b-bench-snapshot.md) — pre-T1b → Phase 1 → Phase 2 pre-fix → Phase 2 + lazy-entry fast-path. Fast-path beats pre-T1b by −25% on no-accumulator recompute fanout by eliminating per-recompute HashSet allocations the old `memo_commit_accumulator_phase` carried unconditionally.
- [2026-05-18 UI-shape benches](performance/2026-05-18-ui-shape-benches.md) — push-engine throughput on UI-shaped workloads (flat / layered / sparse / tree) across wasm-gc + JS. Confirms 60 Hz headroom at 1000 nodes; baseline for any future UI-library work on incr.
- [2026-05-27 Static/applicative Derived fast-path probe](performance/2026-05-27-static-derived-fast-path-probe.md) — lower-bound, integrated, and UI-shape benches for fixed-dependency derived recomputation; records the package-private static path. Public exposure remains closed by the 2026-06-01 ADR.
- [2026-06-01 DSL-shaped authoring pipeline benches](performance/2026-06-01-dsl-authoring-benches.md) — coarse staged `Derived` authoring chain vs per-node `DerivedMap` and sparse `ReachableDerived` inspector variants across wasm-gc + JS.
- [2026-06-01 Graph-editor recompute path benches](performance/2026-06-01-graph-editor-recompute-benches.md) — durable graph/document recomputation vs ephemeral hover, drag preview, and viewport updates; records live-drag and commit-at-end behavior across wasm-gc + JS.
- [2026-06-05 Typed Spreadsheet trace benches](performance/2026-06-05-typed-spreadsheet-trace-benches.md) — full-sheet `Worksheet::trace` scan vs bounded observed-formula tracing for issue #179 across wasm-gc + JS, with the manual regression workflow for future trace changes.
- [2026-06-05 Typed Spreadsheet event trace feasibility](performance/2026-06-05-typed-spreadsheet-event-trace-feasibility.md) — issue #199 investigation: derived events can map to formula cells privately, but do not beat the current bounded snapshot path enough to justify the single-listener/API trade-off.
- [2026-06-10 Incremental TEA vs dirty-cell baseline](performance/2026-06-10-incr-tea-vs-dirty-cell-benches.md) — issue #189: the `incr_tea` renderer's verify+backdating skip vs a modeled dirty-cell rebuild. Unread-field mutations skip in O(1) (9.5–159× faster, growing with view size); read-relevant mutations run at par. Keyed planner buys DOM reuse at an O(n²) matching cost; DOM applier measured separately in the 2026-06-12 browser run.
- [2026-06-12 Incremental TEA keyed DOM applier](performance/2026-06-12-incr-tea-keyed-dom-applier-playwright.md) — issue #242: Playwright/Chromium wall-time for keyed list prepend, remove-first, and reverse at N=16/64/256 against a non-keyed rebuild baseline. Keyed reuse wins in the browser (1.70–2.15× at N=256) while confirming reverse remains the weakest case under the original O(n²) planner/re-append applier.
- [2026-06-12 Incremental TEA keyed planner optimization](performance/2026-06-12-incr-tea-keyed-planner-optimization.md) — issue #241: key-map planner path for duplicate-free large keyed lists. At N=256, pure JS planner reverse / prepend / unchanged improve 7.46× / 2.91× / 2.66×; browser reverse improves 395→271 µs with DOM applier behavior unchanged.
- [2026-06-14 UI-shaped adjacent-framework comparison](performance/2026-06-14-ui-shaped-adjacent-framework-comparison.md) — issue #257: benchmark plan for Rabbita, Luna, and `incr_tea` across counter, keyed-list, grid, panel, and editor-shaped workloads, plus a first pure view-construction slice in JS. Records measurement boundaries and blocks direct-DOM/island follow-ups from using pure value-build numbers as runtime evidence.
- [2026-06-14 Mounted counter adjacent-framework comparison](performance/2026-06-14-mounted-counter-adjacent-framework-comparison.md) — follow-up browser slice for #257: Playwright/Chromium initial mount, displayed-count update, and unrelated update across `incr_tea`, Rabbita, and Luna in hidden attached hosts.
- [2026-06-14 Mounted matrix adjacent-framework comparison](performance/2026-06-14-mounted-matrix-adjacent-framework-comparison.md) — batch harness for counter, keyed-list N=16/64/256, and hidden/visible panel mounted cells across `incr_tea`, Rabbita, and Luna.
- [2026-06-14 Mounted row/leaf locality comparison](performance/2026-06-14-mounted-row-leaf-locality-comparison.md) — same-order keyed-row text, row class, and hot nested text leaf mounted cells at N=16/64/256 across `incr_tea`, Rabbita, and Luna.
- [2026-06-15 Incremental TEA direct leaf patching prototype](performance/2026-06-15-incr-tea-direct-leaf-patching-prototype.md) — issue #254 prototype: pure direct leaf/attribute ids in `Html`, mount-boundary watched string resolvers, and row/leaf `incr_tea-direct` browser timings.
- [2026-06-15 Incremental TEA activation-islands measurement](performance/2026-06-15-incr-tea-activation-islands-measurement.md) — issue #255 measurement-first gate: editor/sidebar/inspector-shaped collapsed vs hidden-mounted vs visible update costs before any visibility/idle-driven Watch activation prototype.
- [2026-06-15 Incremental TEA inactive-root prototype](performance/2026-06-15-incr-tea-inactive-root-prototype.md) — issue #255 prototype result: DOM-preserving inactive workspace roots keep hidden updates at collapsed-update scale and pay the deferred watched-view read/diff on activation catch-up.
- [2026-06-15 Incremental TEA inactive-root amortized benchmark](performance/2026-06-15-incr-tea-inactive-root-amortized.md) — post-#255 amortized result: 10/100/1000 inactive updates plus one activation catch-up for the editor/sidebar/inspector-shaped workspace root.
- [2026-06-15 Incremental TEA inactive-root cohort benchmark](performance/2026-06-15-incr-tea-inactive-root-cohorts.md) — multi-root follow-up: one shared workspace Program mounted into 1/4/16 inactive DOM roots, measuring 10/100/1000-update bursts and activation of one root versus all roots.
- [2026-06-16 Incremental TEA independent inactive-root cohort benchmark](performance/2026-06-16-incr-tea-independent-inactive-root-cohorts.md) — independent-root follow-up: one workspace Program/view Watch per inactive DOM root, broadcasting 10/100/1000-update bursts across 1/4/16 roots and measuring activation of one root versus all roots.
- [2026-06-16 Incremental TEA shared vs independent inactive-root cohorts](performance/2026-06-16-incr-tea-shared-vs-independent-inactive-root-cohorts.md) — synthesis of PR #277 (shared Program/Watch across inactive roots) and PR #278 (independent Program/Watch per root): 16-root activation-only and total-burst ratios, evidence-backed conclusions only.

- [Comparison with alien-signals](design/comparison-with-alien-signals.md) — trade-offs versus alien-signals-style reactive frameworks
- [Comparison with salsa](design/comparison-with-salsa.md) — how `incr` relates to rust-analyzer's salsa query layer: the shared firewall core, three divergences (push runtime, GC-by-roots vs LRU, multi-runtime), and a backdating deep-dive (`BackdateEq`, `AcceptedDerived` / `RetainedDueToError`)
- [Implementation specs](design/specs/) — written-ahead design specs for individual subsystems (paired with [plans/](plans/) or already shipped)
- [2026-04-20 Architecture Assessment](design/specs/2026-04-20-architecture-assessment.md) — verified snapshot of current architecture; records why no structural redesign is warranted today and what would justify revisiting T1b (commit-phase trait) and T3 (runtime registry)

- [2026-05-28 Static Derived Public-Surface Options](design/specs/2026-05-28-static-derived-public-options.md) — compares public API options and hard requirements for the measured fixed-dependency `Derived` fast path; resolved by the 2026-06-01 ADR as keep-private-with-reopen-criteria
- [2026-05-28 Honest Read-Error Ownership](design/specs/2026-05-28-honest-read-error-ownership.md) — three-way split of read failures (graph→read channel, domain→value-as-`Result`, defects→abort/fail); `Derived::fallible`/`DerivedMap::fallible`; `ReadError` migration for target reads and accumulator verifying reads
- [2026-06-05 `AcceptedDerived`](design/specs/2026-06-05-committed-derived.md) — proposed success-gated authoring primitive that exposes current fallible candidates while retaining the last accepted semantic value (renamed from `CommittedDerived`; file path retains the original slug)

## Decisions (ADRs)

Architecture Decision Records — the *why* behind significant design choices. Kept short; link to implementation specs for details.

| Date | Decision |
|------|----------|
| [2026-04-20](decisions/2026-04-20-accumulator-api.md) | Accumulator API: side-channel collector with per-memo `push_revised_at` incremental invalidation (local-only scope; verifying reads now use `ReadError`) |
| [2026-04-26](decisions/2026-04-26-r2-runtime-decomposition-deferred.md) | R2 (Runtime → services decomposition): deferred indefinitely. Post-R1 Runtime was 427 LOC of thin delegators; service decomposition would be a wrapper-rename without a driver. |
| [2026-04-26](decisions/2026-04-26-modal-runtime-split-not-warranted.md) | Modal Runtime split (per-mode Runtime types): investigation closed. Runtime::new costs 0.11 µs and unused-mode "luggage" is sub-KB; no concrete X→Y per-mode design wish names a shared-CellId-compatible change. |
| [2026-05-17](decisions/2026-05-17-async-at-the-edges.md) | Async-at-the-edges with `moonbitlang/async`: no library changes required. Function coloring enforces the synchrony contract statically. Supported patterns documented; T3 + JS integration test gated on a real driver. |
| [2026-05-17](decisions/2026-05-17-t3-runtime-registry-gated.md) | T3 (`RuntimeRegistry`): design recorded, commissioning gated on multi-runtime async driver, MoonBit preemption, or observable test failure. Replaces two file-scope `Ref[Int]`s + heuristic forgiving-repair with principled liveness queries. |
| [2026-05-17](decisions/2026-05-17-t1b-memo-commit-phase.md) | T1b (`MemoCommitPhase`): accepted with two design-witness implementors (accumulator shipped, visualization event tap designed). Priv trait; accumulator refactor in T1b's PR; public `Runtime::on_derived_event` API (named `Runtime::on_memo_event` when this ADR was written; renamed in 0.8.0) ships with the visualization tap follow-up. Snapshot/restore + CRDT time-travel explicitly deferred. |
| [2026-05-17](decisions/2026-05-17-memo-event-observation.md) | `Runtime::on_derived_event` public API (named `Runtime::on_memo_event` when this ADR was written; renamed in 0.8.0): driver-facing commit-phase event observation. `pub(all) enum DerivedEvent` (formerly `MemoEvent`) with `EnteringCompute` / `Completed(elapsed_ns, backdated)` / `Aborted(elapsed_ns, error)`. Single listener per runtime; sync callback (async bridged via aqueue). In-tree `EventBroadcastPhaseHook` bridges T1b's trait. Pull-memo only; push/fixpoint/batch events deferred. |
| [2026-05-21](decisions/2026-05-21-public-api-ideal-naming.md) | Ideal public API naming: `Input`, `Derived`, `ReachableDerived`, `EagerDerived`, `DerivedMap`, `InputField`, `Watch`, `RuntimeContext`; `get`/`read` return `Result` for fallible derived reads and aborting shortcuts use `_or_abort`. |
| [2026-05-30](decisions/2026-05-30-reachable-derived-differentiate-or-collapse.md) | ReachableDerived — differentiate or collapse. Spike (typed-spreadsheet driver) found `Derived` ≡ `ReachableDerived` today: identical read paths, identical `push_reachable_count` participation, vestigial `is_hybrid`. Proposes (b) differentiate into a genuine eager-when-reachable memo that recomputes during push propagation + emits unified eval events; fallback (a) collapse/deprecate. Status: **Deferred** (2026-05-31) — interim keep + docs corrected; re-open trigger = a projectional-editor viewport over `core/projection_memo.mbt` needing per-edit change-set observation; sunset to (a) collapse before external-user API stability. |
| [2026-06-01](decisions/2026-06-01-static-derived-public-surface.md) | Static Derived public surface: keep the measured static/applicative fast path package-private. No public `Derived::map*`, `Scope::derived_static*`, compatibility conveniences, or raw installer until an `Expr[T]` lowering need, a measured scope-owned attachment win, or downstream UI wrapper duplication supplies a concrete driver. |
| [2026-06-01](decisions/2026-06-01-workspace-layout.md) | Workspace layout: repository-level `moon.work`, publishable `dowdiness/incr` module under `incr/`, checked docs as a workspace member, and standalone example modules. |
| [2026-06-02](decisions/2026-06-02-typed-spreadsheet-runtime-checking.md) | Typed Spreadsheet formula checking: keep the example boundary runtime-checked. Formula installation validates worksheet ownership/cross-sheet references; formula/operator/result type mismatches are reported as `CellResult::TypeError` on read. |
| [2026-06-02](decisions/2026-06-02-typed-spreadsheet-tombstone-lifecycle.md) | Typed Spreadsheet deleted-cell tombstone lifecycle: keep stable lightweight presence anchors; add `Worksheet::compact_deleted_cells()` to prune heavyweight deleted slots after commit without breaking delete/recreate invalidation. |
| [2026-06-09](decisions/2026-06-09-composable-runtime-hooks.md) | Composable runtime hooks (#210): reopen the Memo Event Observation ADR's multi-listener deferral. One generic `ListenerRegistry[F]` backs both hooks; singleton APIs map to a reserved slot (source-compatible), additive `add_*_listener` return a public `ListenerId` for idempotent `remove_*`. On-change unguarded (snapshot-before-fire); derived-event keeps the idle guard (buffers events). TEA renderer switches to additive listeners. |
