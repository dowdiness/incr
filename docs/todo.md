# TODO

Concrete, actionable tasks for the `incr` library.

## Error Handling

- [x] Define a `CycleError` type and return it instead of calling `abort()` in verification
- [x] Add `Signal::get_result()` and `Memo::get_result()` that propagate `CycleError`
- [x] Ensure failed `get_result()` calls don't record dependencies (prevents spurious cycles)

## Performance

- [x] Use `HashSet` for deduplication in `ActiveQuery::record` — O(1) per dependency
- [x] Replace `HashMap[CellId, CellMeta]` in `Runtime` with `Array[CellMeta?]` indexed by `CellId.id`, then further migrated to SoA layout
- [x] Convert recursive `maybe_changed_after` to iterative with explicit stack (prevents stack overflow on deep graphs)
- [x] Diff old vs. new dependency lists in `Memo::force_recompute` instead of full replacement
- [x] Explore push-pull hybrid invalidation (requires subscriber/reverse links) — implemented as `HybridMemo`
- [ ] `memo_restore_on_abort` (cells/accumulator.mbt): replace O(n²) linear scan of `prev_contributions` during `touched` iteration with a HashSet lookup. Currently negligible (single-digit accumulator counts per memo), but revisit if a driver hits accumulator-heavy memo aborts. Microbenchmark before changing — per the perf-optimization rule, stale complexity claims aren't evidence.

## API Improvements

- [x] Add `Runtime::batch(fn)` that defers revision bump until the closure completes
- [x] Add two-phase signal values with revert detection in batch mode
- [x] Roll back pending batch writes when batch closure raises (graceful error path)
- [x] `Signal::set_unconditional(value)` already exists — always bumps the revision

### Introspection API (Phase 2A - High Priority)

- [x] Add `Signal::id(self) -> CellId`
- [x] Add `Signal::durability(self) -> Durability`
- [x] Add `Memo::dependencies(self) -> Array[CellId]`
- [x] Add `Memo::changed_at(self) -> Revision`
- [x] Add `Memo::verified_at(self) -> Revision`
- [x] Add `Runtime::cell_info(self, CellId) -> CellInfo?` struct
- [x] Define `CellInfo` struct with all cell metadata
- [x] Add `Signal::debug(self) -> String` for formatted output
- [x] Add `Memo::debug(self) -> String` for formatted output

### Error Diagnostics (Phase 2A - High Priority)

- [x] Change `CycleError` to include cycle path: `CycleDetected(CellId, Array[CellId])`
- [x] Add `CycleError::path(self) -> Array[CellId]`
- [x] Add `CycleError::format_path(self, Runtime) -> String` for human-readable output
- [x] Update cycle detection in `cells/verify.mbt` to track path during traversal

### Per-Cell Callbacks (Phase 2B - High Priority)

- [x] Add `on_change : (() -> Unit)?` field to `CellMeta` (or type-erased callback)
- [x] Add `Signal::on_change(self, f : (T) -> Unit) -> Unit`
- [x] Add `Memo::on_change(self, f : (T) -> Unit) -> Unit`
- [x] Add `Signal::clear_on_change(self) -> Unit`
- [x] Add `Memo::clear_on_change(self) -> Unit`
- [x] Fire per-cell callbacks before `Runtime::fire_on_change()`
- [x] Test callback execution order (per-cell before global)

### Builder Pattern / Ergonomics (Phase 2C - Done)

- [x] Unified `Signal::new` with `durability? : Durability = Low` (replaces `Signal::new_with_durability`)
- [x] Added `label? : String` to `Signal::new` and `Memo::new`
- [x] Added `label? : String` and `durability?` to `create_signal` (replaces `create_signal_durable`)
- [x] Added `label? : String` to `create_memo`
- [x] Labels propagate through `CellMeta`, `CellInfo`, `format_path`

- ~~Add `SignalBuilder::build() -> Signal[T]`~~ — skipped
- ~~Define `MemoBuilder[T]` struct with similar pattern~~ — skipped
- ~~Document builder pattern in API reference~~ — skipped

### Ergonomics (Phase 2C - Medium Priority)

- ~~Add `Runtime::with_on_change(self, f) -> Runtime` for method chaining~~ — skipped (replaced by `on_change?` optional param in `Runtime::new`)
- [x] Unified `create_signal` with optional `durability?` replaces `create_signal_durable`
- [ ] Explore RAII `BatchGuard` if MoonBit adds destructors

### Graceful Error Handling (Phase 2D — Done)

- [x] Add `rollback_pending` closure to `CellMeta` for per-signal batch rollback hooks
- [x] Add `Runtime::batch_result` returning `Result[Unit, Error]` instead of re-raising
- [x] Add `@incr.batch_result(db, f)` Database helper form

- [x] Add `Memo::get_or_else(fallback : (CycleError) -> T) -> T`
- [x] Add `MemoMap::get_or` and `MemoMap::get_or_else` with identical semantics

### Advanced (Phase 4)

- [x] Add subscriber (reverse) links for push-based invalidation
- [x] Add `Runtime::dependents(CellId) -> Array[CellId]` (requires subscriber links)
- [x] Add `CellOps` trait for uniform cell dispatch (`cells/cell_ops.mbt`)

- [x] Add `Effect` push-mode side-effect cell (`cells/effect.mbt`)
- [x] Add level-sorted push propagation engine (`cells/propagate.mbt`)
- [x] Add `HybridMemo[T]` push-pull hybrid memo (`cells/hybrid_memo.mbt`)
- [x] Add `create_hybrid_memo` Database helper and `Readable` impl
- [x] Re-export `HybridMemo` from root facade (`incr.mbt`)
- [x] Add Datalog primitives: `Relation[T]`, `Rule`, `Runtime::fixpoint()`

## Tracked Struct Support

- [x] Add `TrackedCell[T]` wrapping `Signal[T]` for field-level dependency isolation (`cells/tracked_cell.mbt`)
- [x] Add full `TrackedCell` API: `new`, `get`, `get_result`, `set`, `set_unconditional`, `id`, `durability`, `on_change`, `clear_on_change`, `is_up_to_date`, `as_signal`
- [x] Add `Trackable` trait with `cell_ids(Self) -> Array[CellId]`
- [x] Add `Readable` impl for `TrackedCell[T]`
- [x] Add `create_tracked_cell` helper function (mirrors `create_signal` pattern)
- [x] Add `gc_tracked[T : Trackable](rt, tracked)` no-op stub (call site established for Phase 4 migration)
- [x] Re-export `TrackedCell` from root facade (`incr.mbt`)
- [x] Whitebox tests in `cells/tracked_cell_wbtest.mbt`
- [x] Integration tests in `tests/tracked_struct_test.mbt`

## Cleanup: Vestigial `dirty` Flag

After the hybrid dirty-marking removal (HybridMemo no longer participates in push propagation),
the `dirty` field on `MemoData` is never set to `true`. All checks are no-ops. These tasks
clean up the dead logic.

- [x] Remove `dirty` field from `MemoData` in `cells/pull_memo.mbt`
- [x] Remove `not(root.dirty)` guards in `cells/verify.mbt` (lines ~92, ~97, ~152)
- [x] Remove `memo.dirty = false` assignment in `cells/verify.mbt` finalization (line ~205)
- [x] Remove `cell.dirty = false` in `HybridMemo::get()` slow path (`cells/hybrid_memo.mbt`)
- [x] Remove `not(cell.dirty)` from `HybridMemo::get()` fast path — collapse to `verified_at >= current_revision`
- [x] Update `HybridMemo::get()` doc comments that reference "dirty"
- [x] Update `cells/hybrid_memo.mbt` top-of-file doc comment referencing dirty flag

## HybridMemo Lifecycle

- [x] Add `HybridMemo::dispose()` — remove from subscriber sets, mark `cell_index` slot as `Disposed`
- [x] Add whitebox test for dispose (verify subscriber cleanup)

## Dispose / GC — Layer 4b: Push Suspension ✓ (PR #32)

- [x] Gate `on_observe` to 0→1 observer transition (`add_gc_root` returns previous count)
- [x] `PushReactiveData::on_unobserve` — suspend push by unsubscribing (guard: `subscribers.is_empty()`)
- [x] `PushReactiveData::on_observe` — recompute with fresh tracking on reactivation
- [x] `Scope::add_observer` — register observer with scope dispose hooks
- [x] `MemoMap::sweep` — remove disposed entries after gc()
- [x] Edge case tests: GC of suspended, dispose during suspension, source disposal, fixpoint abort
- [x] Integration tests via public API

## Push Propagation Efficiency

- [x] In mixed graphs (reactives + hybrid memos), `push_propagate_from` BFS traverses all reachable hybrid/pull memo subscriber links even when no push node is downstream of the changed signal. Consider per-signal transitive-push-subscriber tracking to skip unnecessary traversal. — Implemented via `push_reachable_count` (PR #24): O(1) per-source gate + inner BFS pruning; 62x–1335x speedup on mixed graphs.

## Internal Refactoring

- [x] Extract `Runtime::advance_revision(durability)` to consolidate duplicated revision-bump logic
- [x] Extract `Runtime::mark_input_changed(id)` helper to consolidate duplicated signal-commit logic
- [x] Replace silent `None => Ok(true)` fallback in `finish_frame_changed` with `abort(...)` assertion
- [x] Replace silent `None` skip in `commit_batch` with `abort(...)` assertion
- [x] Add runtime ownership check (`id.runtime_id != self.runtime_id`) in `Runtime::get_cell`
- [x] Simplify `Signal::get_result` to delegate to `Ok(self.get())`
- [x] Improve `Memo::get` abort message to use `CycleError::format_path`
- [x] Centralize cycle-path construction with `CycleError::from_path(path, closing_id)`
- [x] Move pipeline traits to `pipeline/pipeline_traits.mbt`; mark experimental in docs
- [x] Convert safe C-style loops to idiomatic `for .. in` syntax in `memo.mbt` and `runtime.mbt`
- [x] Replace `Array[CellMeta]` with SoA layout: `pull_signals : Array[PullSignalData]`, `pull_memos : Array[PullMemoData]`, `cell_index : Array[CellRef]`
- [x] Add `CellRef` enum (`PullSignal(Int) | PullMemo(Int)`) for O(1) dispatch via `cell_index`
- [x] Replace `maybe_changed_after` with `pull_verify` using explicit `PullVerifyFrame` stack
- [x] Add root durability fast-path to `pull_verify` (skip dep walk if no relevant-durability input changed)
- [x] Add per-dep durability shortcut and short-circuit on first detected change in `pull_verify`
- [x] Remove `CellMeta` and `CellKind` entirely; add `get_durability`, `get_pull_signal`, `get_pull_memo` helpers

## Testing

- [x] Stress test: deep dependency chain (250 levels) to verify iterative verification
- [x] Wide fanout test: single signal with many downstream memos
- [x] Test `Memo` with custom `Eq` types where structural equality differs from identity
- [x] Test cycle detection across 3+ mutually recursive memos

## Package Structure

- [x] Split flat single-package library into four MoonBit sub-packages (`types/`, `cells/`, `pipeline/`, root facade)
- [x] Move pure value types (`Revision`, `Durability`, `CellId`) to `dowdiness/incr/types`
- [x] Move all engine code to `dowdiness/incr/cells`
- [x] Move experimental pipeline traits to `dowdiness/incr/pipeline`
- [x] Re-export all public types from root via `pub type` transparent aliases in `incr.mbt`
- [x] Move whitebox tests (`*_wbtest.mbt`) to `cells/` for private field access
- [x] Move unit tests (`*_test.mbt`) to `cells/` (co-located with source)
- [x] Create `tests/` package for integration tests exercising the full `@incr` public API
- [x] Zero breaking changes — downstream users see identical `@incr` API

## Salsa-Style Query API (Phase 4E)

Each step builds on the previous. See [semantic-interning.md](research/semantic-interning.md) for interning design and [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) for context.

**Status (2026-03-28):** Partially deferred — see [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) Phase 4E for rationale.
Recommended next step before implementing these: add a simple type system to the lambda calculus
parser. Boundary ③ (CST → Typed AST) needs to exist before these features can be validated.

### Semantic Interning ✓ (PR #34)

- [x] `InternId` struct with `index : Int`, `Hash`, `Eq`, `Compare` (in `types/`)
- [x] `InternTable[T]` with `intern`, `get`, `len`
- [x] Unit tests for round-trip, dedup, len tracking
- [x] Integration test: `InternId` as `MemoMap` key (via lambda type-checker, loom#81)

### Semantic Interning — Follow-ups

- [ ] Add `InternId` table discriminator (table ID field) to prevent cross-table mixups.
      Currently `InternId { index }` only — an ID from one table silently indexes another.
      Add when multiple InternTables coexist in the same pipeline.
- [ ] Add `InternTable::clear()` or generation-based GC for long-lived sessions.
      Grow-only is acceptable for short editing sessions; production use needs cleanup.
- [x] Add integration test: `InternId` in `Relation` for O(1) Datalog fact equality

### Tracked Structs

No new library code needed — `TrackedCell`, `Trackable`, and `MemoMap` already provide all
required infrastructure. The work here is demonstrating the pattern, not building it.

- [ ] Add integration test: `InternId` + `TrackedCell` fields, field-level dependency granularity
      (change one field, only dependent memos recompute; identity key stable across revisions)

### Accumulators — SHIPPED

Shipped 2026-04-20. See [ADR](decisions/2026-04-20-accumulator-api.md) and archived [implementation spec](archive/completed-phases/2026-04-19-accumulator-api-design.md).

Resolved design questions:
- **Type erasure:** handle-local typed `Array[T]` storage per accumulator; Runtime stores only erased `AccumulatorSlot`.
- **Transitive collection:** deferred — Path 1 is local-only. Module-level aggregation lives in driver code. Add `accumulated_transitive` as a separate method if a future driver needs it.
- **Backdating of `Array[T]`:** sidestepped via per-memo `push_revised_at : Revision` counter. Comparison is `current_rev > stored_rev`, not array equality.
- **Invalidation on diagnostic-only change:** synthetic dep `(accumulator_slot, producer_memo) → revision` recorded during tracked `accumulated(acc)` reads; mismatch invalidates consumer even when the producer's return value is backdate-equal.

- [x] Build Boundary ③ use case first (lambda type-checker with type errors as diagnostics) — loom#81
- [x] Design accumulator API informed by concrete use case — [archive/completed-phases/2026-04-19-accumulator-api-design.md](archive/completed-phases/2026-04-19-accumulator-api-design.md)
- [x] Implement side-channel collection — incr PR #42 + fix `1715981`
- [x] Integrate with dependency tracking and backdating — synthetic dep via `push_revised_at` per producer memo
- [x] Add tests for diagnostic collection across multiple queries — 41 accumulator tests (whitebox) + lambda driver incrementality test (loom PR #94)
- [x] Driver migration — lambda type-checker moved off `TypeResult.diagnostics` to `Accumulator[TypeDiagnostic]` (loom PR #94)

## Boundary 3: Type-Checker Follow-ups

Boundary 3 (bidirectional type-checker) shipped in loom#81 + incr#34. These follow-ups
improve correctness, performance, and integration beyond the infrastructure validation scope.

### Incremental Pipeline

- [x] **Incremental name resolution** — per-def `resolve_memos` chain
      replaces the coarse `resolve_typed(term)` at the pipeline parent
      memo. Editing one def body walks only that def's AST for
      resolution; unchanged defs backdate via `TypedTerm` `Eq`. Shipped
      in loom PR #95 (merged 2026-04-20, `25a6be4`). Public API
      unchanged. See `examples/lambda/src/typecheck/typecheck.mbt`
      (`split_defs`, `resolve_memos`).
- [x] **MemoMap stale entries after structural rebuild** — MemoMap internal Memos are
      Runtime-owned, so chain-scope dispose can't reach them. Added `MemoMap::clear()`
      (disposes every wrapper and empties the entry map) and invoked it from
      `build_typecheck_pipeline_with_index` in `examples/lambda` before each rebuild.
      The `is_disposed()` + name guard remains as a defensive fallback for any InternId
      that outlives a rebuild window. See loom/examples/lambda `typecheck.mbt`.
- [x] **Stable identity across insertions** — `DefEntry` shrunk to `{ name }` (hash on name
      only); position lookup moved to a `name_to_idx : HashMap[String, Int]` on
      `PipelineState`, rebuilt whenever the chain is torn down. Inserting a def at position 0
      no longer changes any existing `InternId`, so caller-side caches keyed off `DefId`
      (diagnostics, hover, go-to-definition) keep hitting across that edit. The `MemoMap`
      wrappers themselves are still cleared on structural rebuild — identity stability is
      the API guarantee, not wrapper reuse. Semantic note: duplicate names in one module
      now collide on a single `InternId` (last wins, matches resolver shadowing); prior
      positional keys let each occurrence be queried separately. Whitebox test pins the
      guarantee ("MemoMap: DefId stays stable after prepending a def at position 0") in
      `examples/lambda/src/typecheck/typecheck_wbtest.mbt`.

### Type System Extensions (deferred — not needed for infra validation)

- [ ] Polymorphism / type variables / unification
- [ ] Position/span tracking in diagnostics (AST doesn't carry spans yet)

### Integration

- [x] **Wire into unified Parser** — shipped via `attach_typecheck` (`examples/lambda/src/typed_parser.mbt`):
      a bridge `Memo` reads `parser.syntax_tree()` and feeds
      `build_typecheck_pipeline_with_index`, so edits flow `Signal[String]` → parse → typecheck
      end-to-end. (The earlier `ReactiveParser` target became obsolete when loom unified
      `ReactiveParser` + `ImperativeParser` into a single `@loom.Parser[Ast]` — see
      loom ADR 2026-04-17.)
- [ ] **TypedTerm duplication cleanup** — `convert.mbt` is a full tree copy to add `None` annotations;
      consider a side-table of annotations keyed by node identity if the typechecker expands

## Pipeline Traits — Deferred (move to loom)

**Status (2026-04-08):** Deferred. Current pipeline traits (`Sourceable`, `Parseable`, `Checkable`,
`Executable` in `incr/pipeline/`) are too generic to be useful — everything returns `Array[String]`,
no typed AST/CST, no incremental semantics. Only exercised by a test fixture (`CalcPipeline`).
Zero production usage.

**Decision:** Don't integrate into loom's `ReactiveParser` now. The concrete methods on
`ReactiveParser` (`set_source`, `cst`, `diagnostics`, `term`) already serve as the de facto
pipeline interface. Extracting traits is premature — there isn't a second implementation that
needs the generic interface.

**When to revisit:** When one of these becomes true:
- A second pipeline implementation exists that needs to share an interface with `ReactiveParser`
  (e.g., a push-based pipeline using `Reactive`/`Effect`)
- Post-parse stages (type-checking, evaluation) land in canopy and need a composable extension
  mechanism on `ReactiveParser`
- Generic editor features (autocomplete, hover, go-to-definition) need to work across languages
  via trait dispatch

**Recommended approach when revisiting:**
- Move pipeline traits from `incr/pipeline/` to `loom/src/pipeline/`
- Use capability traits (trait-per-stage) on universally-typed stages only (`String`, `CstStage`,
  `Array[Diagnostic]`). Language-specific stages (AST, eval) stay concrete — MoonBit's `Self`-only
  traits can't abstract over the AST type parameter.
- Consider adding a diagnostics extension protocol to `ReactiveParser` so post-parse stages can
  register diagnostic sources (aggregated in `diagnostics()`)
- Finally Tagless is **not** the right pattern here — pipeline stages have heterogeneous types
  and linear composition, not tree-shaped construction. See conversation notes 2026-04-08.

**Current tasks (keep until migration):**
- [ ] Remove `incr/pipeline/` package when traits move to loom (update `incr.mbt` re-exports)
- [ ] Remove `CalcPipeline` test fixture from `incr/tests/traits_test.mbt`
- [ ] Add capability traits to `loom/src/pipeline/` with `ReactiveParser` impls

## Runtime Modularization (Phase 4 — Remaining)

Architecture analysis completed 2026-04-16. See [design/internals.md](design/internals.md#architecture-analysis-2026-04-16) for full diagnosis.

### Completed (PR #35)

- [x] Add `PropagationPhase` enum (`Idle`, `PushPropagating`, `InFixpoint`, `GarbageCollecting`) with `enter_phase`/`leave_phase` helpers
- [x] Replace `in_fixpoint : Bool` and `in_push_propagation : Bool` with phase checks
- [x] Add phase transition tests (mutual exclusion, panic on re-entry)
- [x] Extract `RevisionState` (`current_revision`, `durability_last_changed`) within RuntimeCore
- [x] Extract `TrackingState` (`tracking_stack`) within RuntimeCore
- [x] Extract `BatchState` (`batch_pending`, `batch_frames`, `batch_max_durability`, `batch_depth`) within RuntimeCore
- [x] Update all whitebox tests to access fields through new struct paths
- [x] Extract shared `diff_and_update_subscribers` function
- [x] Migrate `memo_force_recompute` to use shared function (preserves `seen` set optimization)
- [x] Migrate `finish_tracking` to use shared function

### Completed (PR #36)

- [x] Route batch→push propagation through coordinator (`propagate_changes`) instead of direct call
- [x] `push_propagate_from` now has exactly one caller (`propagate_changes`)
- [x] Delete dead `mark_input_changed` function

### Remaining

- [x] Internal package split — Engine types split across `cells/internal/{shared,pull,push,datalog}/`. Pull engine now contains both `PullSignalData` and `MemoData`; `CycleError` moved to `types/` as a pure-value error (see [spec](design/specs/2026-04-18-incr-stage5-internal-split-design.md) for Stage 5 rationale and the follow-up archive note for the CycleError untangle).
- [x] Verify engine packages do not import each other — `scripts/check-engine-isolation.sh` enforces pairwise engine isolation and the no-back-edge invariant.
- [x] Complete pull-engine split: `MemoData` moved to `cells/internal/pull/memo_data.mbt`. `CycleError` now lives in `types/` as a pure value; `format_path` drops its `Runtime` parameter (breaking change — labels are captured at error-construction time). `CellLifecycle` impl for `MemoData` stays in `cells/pull_memo_lifecycle.mbt` because it needs `Runtime`.
- [x] Factor duplicated `dispose_cell` bodies in `cells/datalog_lifecycle.mbt` — extracted `dispose_datalog_cell` helper (commit `309d904`). Design note at [archive/2026-04-18-datalog-dispose-factoring.md](archive/2026-04-18-datalog-dispose-factoring.md) records why a trait-default alternative was rejected.

## Refactor Audit Findings (2026-04-19)

Post-Stage-5 audit of `cells/` + Codex validation. Stage 6 (engine extraction) remains intentionally deferred; these are the remaining concrete items that survived Codex review.

### Target #1 — Cross-runtime check duplication (DONE)

Six cell read paths inlined the same ~10-line `current_computing_runtime_id` guard (abort on cross-runtime, reset global before aborting). `Memo::get_result_inner` uniquely had a *forgiving* variant that additionally repairs stale global state when this runtime's tracking stack is empty — required for panic-test isolation because `get_untracked` / `MemoMap` bypass the outer strict check.

- [x] Extract `Runtime::check_cross_runtime(cell_runtime_id, kind)` helper (strict variant) — `cells/tracking.mbt:149`
- [x] Replace 6 strict sites: `signal.mbt`, `memo.mbt` (outer), `hybrid_memo.mbt`, `push_reactive.mbt`, `datalog_relation.mbt`, `datalog_functional_relation.mbt`
- [x] Leave `Memo::get_result_inner` with its original forgiving repair logic — it cannot be unified with the strict helper because "stale-global" vs "legitimate cross-runtime" cannot be distinguished locally without a global runtime registry (the forgiving repair relies on checking THIS runtime's stack, which is correct only because `get_untracked` / `MemoMap` paths are same-runtime by construction)

**What the audit got wrong:** the "latent bug" framing was overstated — the memo inner's repair is intentional defensive code for panic-test isolation, not a drifted invariant that should be applied everywhere. An attempted unified "repair everywhere" helper broke 5 tests (4 false-negative cross-runtime aborts + 1 surfaced state-leak). Codex's original direction (unify) was correct; the specific generalization (apply memo inner's heuristic uniformly) was not safe.

**Net change:** 6 sites deduplicated to one helper. No behavior change. ~51 source lines consolidated.

### Target #2 — Cell-registration ritual for free-list kinds (DONE, partial)

- [x] Introduce `Runtime::install_cell[T : CellOps + CellLifecycle]` helper (cells/runtime.mbt) — one generic helper covering all free-list SoA kinds, parameterized over (free_list, array, `fn(Int) -> CellRef`, `fn(CellId) -> T`). Returns `(CellId, Int)` so callers needing the slot index (reactive/effect for post-install sources/level update) can destructure.
- [x] Migrate `Signal::new`, `Reactive::new`, `Effect::new`; delete `Runtime::new_signal_id`
- [x] Leave `Memo::_create` and `HybridMemo::new` as-is — both have a closure-construction cycle (the typed handle is captured inside the stored compute closure); using `install_cell` there would force a `Ref[Memo[T]?]` dance that's worse than the current local pattern. The existing `_create` already factors the pattern within memo's own file.
- [x] Leave datalog constructors as-is — append-only, different shape.
- [x] Add debug invariant `Runtime::check_table_invariant` + whitebox test "runtime: dispatch tables stay index-aligned across all cell kinds" in `soa_wbtest.mbt`

**Net change:** 1 new helper (~24 lines), 1 new invariant + test (~30 lines), 3 sites migrated (signal/reactive/effect), 1 asymmetric helper deleted (`Runtime::new_signal_id`). Tests: 506 → 507 (invariant test added). Memo and HybridMemo keep their local `_create` / inline pattern by design.

### Target #3 — push_lifecycle dispose dedup (DECLINED)

`cells/push_lifecycle.mbt:5-16` (`PushReactiveData::dispose_cell`) and `:68-79` (`PushEffectData::dispose_cell`) are near-identical; differ only in variant arm, SoA array, and free-list. `datalog_lifecycle.mbt` factored this via `dispose_datalog_cell`.

- [x] Evaluated, declined — after Targets #1 and #2, remaining duplication is ~6–10 lines. Unlike #1 (correctness-adjacent drift) and #2 (parallel-array invariant), **no load-bearing invariant rides on unification**; the two inline impls function as self-documenting summaries of push-specific teardown (source-link removal + slot free + `node_count--`). Land opportunistically if `push_lifecycle.mbt` is ever touched for a real reason.

### Intentionally deferred / not recommended

- **Runtime.mbt topic split** — `runtime.mbt` is 850 lines across ~16 sections, but most sections are cohesive and splitting is cosmetic without a concrete driver. Hard constraint for anyone who revisits: **subscriber management (`add/remove_subscriber`) and push-reachable accounting (`push_contribution` / `adjust_push_reachable`) must stay co-located** — they form one invariant cluster.
- **Memo.mbt split** (547 lines) — coherent chapters, no duplication, no pain.
- **cells/ folder reorg** — Stage 5 just moved SoA into `internal/`; another restructure now would churn without a driver.
- **Stage 6 engine extraction** — was "waits for accumulators or similar"; accumulators shipped 2026-04-20 without needing this extraction, so the original motivation is void. Revisit only when parallel computation or a second major extension creates concrete need.

## Reactive Collections (2026-04-19)

Research + design sketches landed in the 2026-04-19 session. See
[reactive-collections.md](research/reactive-collections.md) for the survey and
four-family taxonomy; individual design sketches linked below. All
items here are exploratory — validate via Codex / plan-writing before
implementing.

### Prerequisites (small, independent)

- [x] Add `MemoMap::get_tracked(key) -> V` — thin tracked wrapper over
      the inner Memo's `.get()`. Shipped standalone.
- [ ] Add `MemoMap::remove_except(keys : Set[K]) -> Int` — **blocked on
      Blocker 1** (cross-key dispose aborts verify; see
      [reactive-map-design.md](research/reactive-map-design.md) Codex review
      2026-04-19). Do not land alone.

### `ReactiveMap[K, V]` (Family B)

**Status 2026-04-19 (post PR #41):** Needs re-motivation. The original
value proposition ("fine-grained per-key deps unavailable today") was
refuted during PR #41 review — `MemoMap::get` already records per-key
deps inside a tracked context. `ReactiveMap`'s remaining value is
coordination with an upstream key set (disposal of stale entries,
tracked `iter()`), not per-key isolation. See
[reactive-map-design.md](research/reactive-map-design.md) "Why v1's framing was
wrong" and "Codex review 2026-04-19" for the full story.

- [x] Codex-review the design sketch for semantic and integration
      issues (done 2026-04-19; blockers 1–3 must resolve before
      implementation)
- [ ] **Re-motivate against a concrete driver** — lambda name
      resolution alone is a weak driver now that `MemoMap` suffices.
      Do NOT write an implementation plan until a driver requires
      something `MemoMap` + `get_tracked` cannot supply.
- ~~Write implementation plan~~ — gated on re-motivation
- ~~Implement after plan approval~~ — gated on plan

### `Relation::subscribe_delta` (Family A)

Opt-in delta observation on Datalog relations via new `DeltaDispatch`
trait; pre-snapshot + post-diff at commit boundary. See
[relation-delta-observer-design.md](research/relation-delta-observer-design.md).

- [x] Codex-review the design sketch (done 2026-04-19; **redesign
      needed** — plain `Relation[T]` is monotonic with no retractions, no
      commit seam exists for direct inserts, failed batches don't roll
      back relation writes. Do not implement until semantics are resolved.)
- [ ] Identify a concrete driver in canopy (logging, UI reconciliation,
      IPC) — don't implement speculatively
- [ ] Implement as one PR once driver exists (3-5 days)

### Family C (Nominal Memoization over Persistent Trees)

Long-horizon bet. Requires `Memo::new_named` + articulation points +
structural-sharing collections. Do not start without a concrete canopy
driver (evaluator / layout / tree-shaped type-checker state). See
[reactive-collections.md](research/reactive-collections.md) "Family C — Design
Sketch for `incr`" section for scope.

## API Naming Cleanup (Deferred)

Context: PR #41 review surfaced that `get_untracked`/`get_tracked`
naming misleads — `Memo::get_untracked` still records per-key deps
when a tracking frame is active (via `get_result_inner` calling
`record_dependency`); the real distinction is **abort vs silent at
top level**, not tracking itself. This misread propagated through
three revisions of `reactive-map-design.md` before Codex caught it.
See [reactive-map-design.md](research/reactive-map-design.md) "Why v1's framing
was wrong" and
`~/.claude/projects/*/memory/feedback_code_verify_before_design.md`.

Not urgent — docs are now accurate and the Caveat on `MemoMap::get_tracked`
documents the actual contract. Revisit if the confusion bites again.

### Method-name candidates

- [ ] Rename `Memo::get_untracked` → something accurate
      (e.g., `Memo::read` or `Memo::read_permissive`). Package-private,
      low breaking-change cost. Body: "reads value, records dep iff
      tracking frame active, never aborts on missing context."
- [ ] Reconsider `MemoMap::get` / `MemoMap::get_tracked` pair naming.
      Current asymmetry (unadorned name = permissive, `_tracked` suffix
      = strict) inverts the option-like convention (`get` strict,
      `get_or` / `try_get` permissive). Candidate pairs:
      `read` (permissive) + `get` (strict), or keep current. Public
      API, so any rename is a breaking change — only do this if a
      downstream consumer actually hits the footgun.
- [ ] Audit other `*_untracked` / `*_tracked` suffixes across
      `cells/` for the same misnaming pattern. Known candidates:
      check `Runtime::read` (top-level observer wrapper) and any
      Observer methods. Grep for the suffix pair explicitly.

### Doc-comment audits

- [ ] Sweep public doc comments for "tracked" / "untracked" shorthand
      that doesn't reflect the actual leaf-level behavior
      (`record_dependency` conditional on tracking frame). Prefer
      describing the abort vs silent distinction directly.
- [ ] Update any remaining design doc that references "untracked means
      doesn't record deps." Currently known:
      [reactive-map-design.md](research/reactive-map-design.md) (marked
      [SUPERSEDED] in-line; a proper rewrite would fold these into the
      v3 narrative) and
      `docs/design/specs/2026-04-15-boundary3-bidirectional-typechecker.md`
      (has an inline [Correction 2026-04-19] note; could be reworked
      if the spec is revisited).

## Documentation

- [x] Add doc comments to all public functions
- [x] Add usage examples for durability in README
- [x] Keep [design/internals.md](design/internals.md) in sync when core algorithms change
- [x] Organize user documentation in `docs/` folder (getting-started, concepts, api-reference, cookbook)
